## About this project

I wanted to create ths project since there is minimal to none documentation on how to export Tables or 2 tables side by side from Aura/LWC component using pdfJS.
The only documentation I could find was exporting html tag tables to pdf using the html_to_pdf method in pdfJS
But in salesforce we rarely create our own table structures rather use the lightning:datatable to render perfect tables.
